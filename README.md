# Machine Learning projects (Supervised Learning)

The machine learning projects deonstrates an understanding of the mathematics behind the building of models for different learning tasks. 
t also demonstrates the extensive use of python language in building models from scratch for supervised learning method.

SYNOPSIS:

This projects were designed to understand how machine learning is buil and used to make predictions (binay). Two projects were implemented here. The first in the sratch directory contains python code for implementing supervised learning model from scratch. The logisticRegression method was implemenyed with Ralph Newton's method used fo fast tracking cinvergence and thus prediction of the model. The model was built to discriminate between benign and malignant classes of a breast cancer dataset. 

The other project entailed building classifier models from sklearn libraries o predict the days in which certain MRI datasets were obtained from samples. Thi supervised learning algorithm was used in making predictions on 14 different sets of datasets.
